					lived in Bethsaida, Capernaum and Jerusalem. He preached in Jerusalem and Judea and was beheaded by
					Herod, AD 44 (Acts 12:1,2). He was a member of the Inner Circle, so called because they were
					accorded special privileges. The New Testament tells us very little about James. His name never
					appears apart from that of his brother, John. They were an inseparable pair (Mark 1:19-20; Matthew
					4:21; Luke 5:1-11).

					He was a man of courage and forgiveness, a man without jealousy, living in the shadow of John, a man
					of extraordinary faith. He was the first of the twelve to become a martyr. His symbol is three
					shells, the sign of his pilgrimage by the sea.",
